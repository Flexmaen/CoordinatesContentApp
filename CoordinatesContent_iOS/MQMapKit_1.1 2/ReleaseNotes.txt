Notes and Known Issues
----------------------
INSTALL CHANGE:

**NOTE: The Other Linker Flag -ObjC is now required.

The framework libxml2 needs to be linked in for this version of the SDK.

When pinch zooming there is a noticeable jump in the animation between discrete zoom levels for overlays.

Changes Since 1.0.1
--------------------
Various stability improvements and tile rendering performance improvements
Fixed an issue introduced in 1.0 where the user location annotation is rendered in the proper position when panning/zooming the map

IMPORTANT CHANGE TO MQROUTE USAGE -- AS OF 1.0.8
---------------------------------
You no longer set linecolor, line width, or fill color on the MQRoute object.
Instead implement the Map View delegate method -(MQOverlayView*)mapView:viewForOverlay:
If you do not implement this method, a line overlay view will be created with default settings:
Line Color: Orange
Line Width: 3.5
Fill Color: Black

When implementing this method, you may test for MQRoutePolyline as the type to distinguish between other 
types of MQPolyline
