It does the communication with the server and displayes objects that are linked to coordinates
and also contain images and descriptions. If you change the server URL within the source code
and provide comminication in the requested form, you can use this app with your own website.

For the server-side you need and URL that will server the data in the correct format. (The paceholder
in the app for this is anything with "server.url")
Check android_app_housetrails_json.txt and iphone_app_housetrails_plist.txt for expected data.

You are allowed to use this source for your own app of any other purpuse as long as you
- chose a different name and app ID
